# cplustorch
Its aim is to implement PyTorch functionality in C++, and help u have a better understanding of pytorch.

Now we've built the tensor class and implemented several fundamental functions, including broadcasting, computation, autograd, and key activation functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. The next step could involve implementing optimization algorithms and neural network layers, though the direction may evolve based on project needs. Regardless, I'll continue refining and addressing any issues that arise in this project.
